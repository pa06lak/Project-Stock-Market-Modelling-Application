**Project Stock Market Modelling Application**
Overview
This project focuses on building a stock market modelling application that leverages machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. It encompasses data handling, web scraping, and provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application.

Python Script
The main script for running the application is main.py. This script integrates all components of the project, including data processing, machine learning model training, and prediction.

Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to create an efficient tool for predicting stock prices using historical data and machine learning algorithms. This helps users make informed decisions based on the model's predictions.

How It Works
Data Collection: The application uses web scraping to gather real-time stock data.
Data Processing: Collected data is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
Model Training: Machine learning models are trained on the processed data to predict future stock prices.
User Interface: A simple interface allows users to input stock data and view predictions.
Features
Data Handling: Efficiently processes and manages stock market data.
Machine Learning: Implements robust models to predict stock prices.
Web Scraping: Automatically gathers up-to-date stock data from the web.
User Interface: Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the application.
Modular Design: Well-structured codebase for easy modifications and extensions.
